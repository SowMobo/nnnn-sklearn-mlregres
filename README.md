The goal is to create a neural network that predicts the Python skill level (Finxter rating) using the five input features (answers to the questions):

WEEK: How many hours have you been exposed to Python code in the last 7 days?
YEARS: How many years ago have you started to learn about computer science?
BOOKS: How many coding books are in your shelf?
PROJECTS: What percentage of your Python time do you spend implementing real-world projects?
EARN: How much do you earn per month (round to $1000) from selling your technical skills (in the widest sense)?
